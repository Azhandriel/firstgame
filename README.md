First game in Unity

For this game I used a tutorial found here: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial

I picked this tutorial as it seemed easy and not that time-consuming, because I have never used Unity before. It was a good starting point to learn Unity's mechanics and terms.

I didn't encounter any overly difficult parts. At the beginning it took some time to getting used to camera controls etc. But the tutorial explained everything very well. The hardest part for me was setting up Github on MacOS, but I managed. I hope.

I had my first encounter with Unity and learned the difference between C and C#, as I have done some programming using C in the past. I learned, that there is a vast amount of opportunities to make different games and apply different game mechanincs using Unity.

As a bonus, I did not add anything to the game.
